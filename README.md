This is my fork for my 2019 Rav4. Should be good for all TSS2, however, YMMV.

This adds:
* TSS2 Distane Button with 3 profiles
* More Aggresive Start from Standstill
* Tweak Toyota Long Tuning for My Tastes
* Add Toggle to Enable Use of Gas Pedal While Openpilot is Engaged
* Add Toggle to Enable Automatic Raw Log and camera file Uploading

Big thanks to https://github.com/krkeegan/openpilot
